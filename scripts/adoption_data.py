"""User adoption data for the NTPC dashboard — LIVE from the VisiLean PowerBI APIs.

Answers "who is actually using VisiLean on this project": which user updated which
activity, what kind of update it was, and when — sliceable by department, activity
type, location, package, activity owner and ownership.

Where the data comes from
-------------------------
VisiLean returns the audit trail on the task endpoint as one row per (task, event),
with the event written as an English sentence in `activityHistory` and its timestamp
in `historyDateTime`:

    Task 'KP to EPC PO Placement' set to 'Not Ready' as a result of action by Fenil Rana
    Task 'Support Installation at IDT side' imported from file '....mpp' by Shreyanshi Jaiswal.
    Task 'Manufacturing Clearance' assigned to Yash Lakdavala by Fenil Rana

So the acting user has to be parsed out of the sentence. To keep that honest we build
a roster first (VisiLean assignees + anyone the trail credits at least three times)
and only ever attribute an event to a name on that roster — a loose "by (.+)" capture
would otherwise invent users out of note text.

Two requests, both type=task on the one project token:
  * the history feed, carrying every Include* flag - IncludeStatusChange /
    IncludeReschedule / IncludeTaskCreation / IncludeWorkforceAssignment /
    IncludeQuantities / IncludeConstraintNotes / IncludeOther - which returns the whole
    trail in one response, de-duplicated on (taskId, timestamp, sentence)
  * the plain task feed, used only for the assignee roster and the project size

Known gap: the PowerBI API exposes no file/attachment events, so document uploads
cannot be counted. Verified 07-Sep-2026 — IncludeAttachments / IncludeFiles /
IncludeDocuments all return the same payload with no file events. `meta.noAttachments`
carries that fact so the page can say so rather than imply zero uploads.

This reads the NTPC project, so it uses the NTPC project's one VisiLean token: env
VL_TOKEN_NTPC, or the "ntpc" entry in VL_TOKENS_JSON (GitHub Actions secrets), or the
flat scripts/vl_tokens.json next to this script (never committed) - see vl_token.py.
There is no separate adoption token. Emits scripts/adoption_data.json.
