"""How fresh is every published dashboard, and is its sync alive?

    python scripts/check_sync.py

Reads the PUBLISHED pages, not the working copy, so it reports what a reader actually
sees. Age alone does not mean broken - the workers publish only when something changes -
so each project's workflow is checked too, and the two are reported separately.

Exits non-zero if any dashboard's sync is failing or has never run, so it can be used
as a check rather than only read by eye.
